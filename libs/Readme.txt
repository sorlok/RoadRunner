In order to compile Road Runner with Sim Mobility support, you will need the following libraries (exact versions). 
You *do not* need their sources; just the libraries will do:
   * libs/gson-2.2.2.jar  
   * libs/mina-core-2.0.7.jar  
   * libs/slf4j-api-1.6.6.jar
   * libs/commons-codec-1.8.jar

If these names are identical, you can simply Refresh the Eclipse project and everything will work.
